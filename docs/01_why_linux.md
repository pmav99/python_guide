# Why linux?

An important distinction is between:

- the development environment (i.e. where you *write* the code)
- the production environment (i.e. where you *run* the code)


In order to make debugging easier,
you should strive to make the development environment
as similar as possible to the production environment

Practically speaking, in science and web-development,
the vast majority of the code that you will write will be executed on Linux
(HPC, HTC, super-computers, web servers etc).

So, use Linux!
